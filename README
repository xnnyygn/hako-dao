INTRODUCTION
============
If you want some feature like gorm in Grails(http://grails.org/), or model 
level in Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/), and you have to use some 
low-level DAO framework like IBATIS(http://ibatis.apache.org/) even JDBC for 
performance purpose, hako-dao is your choice. 

hako-dao provides mapping from user model and low-level SQL, in another word, 
hako-dao dynamically create SQL by common SQL model. The SQL model refer to 
SQL grammar of H2 database (http://www.h2database.com/html/grammar.html) and
some database specified functions called SQL dialect in hako-dao like in 
Hibernate(http://www.hibernate.org/). However, hako-dao don't focus on 
relationship between entities, it is a framework help you get rid of writing
and maintaining SQL. Feel free to use it.
